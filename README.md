# pgttt: Solution code to "The Tic-Tac-Toe Mysteries of Xerloc O'Xolmes"
Bart Massey 2024-08

The inimitable Andrew "Zarf" Plotkin just published a
masterpiece on his blog: [*The Tic-Tac-Toe Mysteries of
Xerloc O'Xolmes*](https://blog.zarfhome.com/2024/08/tic-tac-toe-mysteries).

Since Zarf constructed his puzzles with the help of a Python
solver that he described a bit, I thought I'd try a quick
replication. This code contains a Python implementation of
"Pretty Good Tic-Tac-Toe" together with the setup and
solutions for the given problems. Of course, it's a giant
spoiler, so don't run it unless you want to know.
